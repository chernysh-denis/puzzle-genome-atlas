# Objective Genes

## OBJ-001 — Reach target value

- Lifecycle: `Active`
- Claim status: `Observation`
- Evidence quality: `Direct`
- Confidence: `High`
- Definition: produce an element whose value meets a declared threshold.
- Parameters: target value.
- Evidence: [2048 decomposition](../games/0-9/2048.md).
- Novelty: not assessed; this is part of the baseline genome.

## OBJ-002 — Maximise accumulated score

- Lifecycle: `Active`
- Claim status: `Observation`
- Evidence quality: `Direct`
- Confidence: `High`
- Definition: increase an unbounded or session-bounded numerical evaluation.
- Excludes: reaching one fixed threshold as the only objective.
- Evidence: [2048 decomposition](../games/0-9/2048.md).
- Novelty: not assessed; this is part of the baseline genome.

## OBJ-003 — Preserve move availability

- Lifecycle: `Active`
- Claim status: `Observation`
- Evidence quality: `Corroborated`
- Confidence: `High`
- Definition: avoid a state in which no legal state-changing action remains.
- Includes: survival as an implicit continuing objective.
- Excludes: maximising score independently of terminal mobility.
- Evidence: [2048 decomposition](../games/0-9/2048.md).
- Novelty: not assessed; this is part of the baseline genome.
